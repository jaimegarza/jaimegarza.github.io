###### I

When you say no<br/>
your face barely moves.

When you say yes<br/>
your soul barely smiles.

Tonight,<br/>
when you say maybe<br/>
your body barely<br/>
and suddenly<br/>
shivers.

###### II

Your bed is cold and<br/>
I sleep over your mark.<br/>
Your mark is here and<br/>
I sleep over your memory.<br/>
Your memory transcends and<br/>
I sleep no more.

Your day is tomorrow and<br/>
I dream wide open.

Your new day is<br/>
when your closed honey<br/>
will sleep over<br/>
the imprint of my bare night.

I now tremble.

I must lay down tonight<br/>
with all my strength<br/>
so when your turn comes<br/>
tomorrow night<br/>
you too will shiver<br/>
knowing that my body was<br/>
so close to yours<br/>
off by a single day.

I donâ€™t know why<br/>
but in your side of the bed<br/>
I still tremble.
