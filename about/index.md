<img style="float: left; padding: 0 10px 8px 0;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Jaime-Official-246x300.jpg" alt="50th Birthday" width="150" />I was born in Mexico City in the sixties.  I attended school in the "<i>Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México</i>" (or the National Autonomous University of México) where I studied Computer Engineering.  I started my career in professional Software Development on 1979 for the Metal Mechanic industry, which included software for accounting, payroll, engineering processes and CAD, most of it in an Apple II+ in Apple Basic, Pascal and 6502 assembly language. Among the engineering projects that I developed there was a complex system to trace figures for custom assembly of pipes and tubing for industrial applications, and a system to compute pressure for air and water tanks which was used to design pressure vessels.

In 1985 I joined <em>Fralc Consultores</em>, a software development company where I became the director of engineering, specializing on accounting software under Windows 1.0 and later.  Since this was an early system I had to develop printer drivers, system components at the Bios level, and I had to develop a whole ISAM layer for the database.  Later I also worked on OS/2 and Microsoft SQL Server 1.0.  My team and I were one of the three development houses doing Window development in México.  When we ported the system to Windows 3.0, I developed the Generic/Text Only driver for Windows, which shipped with Windows 3.1 and subsequent releases.

During my studies I became quite proficient at compilers and designing languages, and as such I was asked to be a professor at the <i>Universidad La Salle</i> in Mexico City where I taught compiler construction for a couple of years to students of the fifth year, a stint that ended right before my move to the United States in 1992.

The next step was working for newScale, now part of Cisco, where I was the founding engineer, serving as Director of Engineering and Architect.  We created a system for the IT services industry to keep track of requests, and to manage its workflow until completion, including an innovative approach to workflow management.  I was part of the backbone of the organization for nine years.

Groups.  During the Yahoo! layoffs of 2010 I also took charge of Delicious, during its transfer to Avos, and of Yahoo! Pulse, the profile property of Yahoo!  We did develop a new web site for Yahoo! Groups that did not see the light of day due to the layoffs. After two years, the environment in the applications division of Yahoo! was not propitious to growth, and so I decided to leave.

I joined Payvment, Inc., a small startup that is now part of Intuit, where we developed the most important f-commerce platform (commerce through Facebook).  As their architect I did setup the analytics and recommendations engine.  With this platform you could setup a store within a Facebook page, promote your products and as a user you could get the recommended products related to prior behaviors.

I currently work at Oracle. (Responsys Product)</a> where I am a Senior Software Architect in the applications team.  We are a SaaS company with the leading product for e-mail marketing for enterprises</a>. Among others I have:
